## applyEvent.ts

**Purpose:** Pure reducer that applies one realtime `MapEventPayload` to a `MapViewData` snapshot and returns the next state.
**File:** `src/lib/map/applyEvent.ts`

### applyEvent(state: MapViewData, payload: MapEventPayload): MapViewData

Dispatches on `payload.kind` and returns a new `MapViewData` without mutating the input. Called on the client inside `MapCanvas.tsx`'s `useState` + `useEffect` event loop.

**Parameters:**
- `state` — current canvas view data (map header, visible systems, connections).
- `payload` — a validated `MapEventPayload` from a `mapUpdate` WS envelope.

**Returns:** A new `MapViewData` with the event applied, or the original `state` reference when the event has no canvas representation (`map.create`, `map.delete`, `map.restore`, `map.purge`, `access.granted`, `access.revoked`, `share.created`, `share.revoked`).

**Per-kind behaviour:**
- `system.added` — upserts the system node body into `state.systems` (handles both new placements and re-activations of previously-removed systems). Pure node delta: signatures are **not** carried on the event. A re-added system's surviving sigs are hydrated separately by `MapCanvas`, which calls `fetchSystemSignatures` on every `system.added` and upserts the result into `viewData.signatures` — keeping the `pg_notify` payload under the 8 KB ceiling.
- `system.removed` — filters the system out of `state.systems` (rows persist server-side at `visible=false`; the canvas just stops showing them), **and** prunes any connections incident to it plus any signatures whose `mapSystemId` matches it. This mirrors `loadMapForView`, which only returns connections whose both endpoints are visible: a hidden system's connection rows persist in the DB but must not stay in the client snapshot, or consumers that iterate `connections`/`signatures` directly (e.g. `SystemOverlay`) keep rendering the orphans (as "Unknown" rows) until the next reload. The DB rows survive and reappear if the system is re-added. Also prunes the system's chain members **plus their whole descendant closure** — the server deletes the members in the same transaction with no event of their own and lets the parent-FK CASCADE take the subtrees, so the reducer walks the closure itself.
- `system.updated` — merges the patch into the matching system; fields applied: `alias`, `tag`, `intelNotes`, `status`, `locked`, `rallyAt`, `positionX`, `positionY`. When `locked` is present the lock attribution rides with it — `lockedByCharacterId` + `lockedByName` are applied alongside (both cleared to null on unlock).
- `connection.create` — upserts the full edge body into `state.connections` (existence-checked by `id`, so a double-delivered event can't produce a duplicate edge / React key collision).
- `connection.update` — merges the patch into the matching connection; `isStatic`, `sourceBubbled`, `targetBubbled`, and `eolAt` are applied when present (so the static designation, per-end bubbled markers, and canvas EOL countdown reflect the new state without a refetch).
- `connection.delete` — removes the connection by id, and also removes any signatures whose `mapConnectionId` matches it. This mirrors the `ON DELETE CASCADE` on `ap_map_signature.map_connection_id`: the server emits only a `connection.delete` event while Postgres silently cascade-deletes the linked signature rows, so the reducer must drop them too — otherwise the client keeps an orphaned signature whose DB row is gone, and deleting it later 400s with "Signature not found." Also nulls `viaConnectionId` on chain members that traversed it — mirroring the `ON DELETE SET NULL` on `ap_map_chain_member.via_connection_id` (a collapsed hole leaves the occurrence in place).
- `map.update` — updates `state.map.name` if present in the patch; other settings flags have no canvas representation.
- `signature.create` — upserts the full signature body into `state.signatures`.
- `signature.update` — when the event carries a `snapshot` (full post-update row), **upserts** it (replace-by-id, else append) so a client missing this sig's baseline materializes it instead of silently no-op'ing. Otherwise falls back to merging the patch into the matching signature by id; only present keys overwrite. Patch fields include `groupKey`, `typeId`, `eolStage`, the display-only `wormholeCode` (resolved server-side from `universe_wormhole.name` when `typeId` changes), and `updatedAt`.
- `signature.delete` — removes the signature by id.
- `note.created` — upserts the full note body into `state.notes` (existence-checked by `id`).
- `note.updated` — merges the patch into the matching note by id. `title`, `lastEditedByCharacterId`, `lastEditedByName`, `updatedAt` always apply (they always ride the event); `content`, `severity`, `locked`, `positionX`, `positionY` apply only when present.
- `note.deleted` — removes the note by id.
- `chain.created` — upserts the chain body into `state.chains` (the payload's `chainKind` maps onto `MapChain.kind`). Other viewers' personal chains fold in too — the reducer has no viewer identity; the render layer filters by ownership.
- `chain.renamed` — merges `name` + `updatedAt` into the matching chain.
- `chain.deleted` — drops the chain and its members, and nulls `pointerChainId` on members elsewhere that named it (mirrors the member CASCADE + pointer `SET NULL`).
- `chain.member.added` — upserts the member body into `state.chainMembers` by id (re-delivery and the via-connection backfill both arrive as the full body). The audit descriptors `chainName`/`pointerChainName` are ignored.
- `map.create`, `map.delete`, `map.restore`, `map.purge` — return `state` unchanged. The last two are admin-only events; non-admin viewers never see a soft-deleted map open, so there is no canvas state to reconcile.
- `access.granted`, `access.revoked` — return `state` unchanged. Per-title feature-delegation grants change server-side authority only and carry no canvas state.
- `share.created`, `share.revoked` — return `state` unchanged. `MapCanvas` reads these off the envelope itself to keep the live-share indicator current.

### Depends On
- `MapViewData`, `MapSystemNode`, `MapConnectionEdge`, `MapSignature`, `MapNote`, `MapChain`, `MapChainMember` — types from `@/types`
- `MapEventPayload` — type from `@/lib/realtime/protocol`
