## panels.ts

**Purpose:** Single source of truth for the map dashboard's panels and their default arrangement (map-layout-builder).
**File:** `src/lib/map/layout/panels.ts`

---

### LAYOUT_CONFIG_VERSION
`number` (currently `2`). Bumped when `MapLayoutConfig`'s stored shape changes incompatibly; gates the `migrateLayout` upgrade of saved layouts.

### PANEL_BREAKPOINTS
`Record<Breakpoint, number>` — `{ lg: 1200, md: 768, sm: 0 }`. Min container widths (px) for the responsive grid; shared by the grid component (later stages).

### PANEL_COLS
`Record<Breakpoint, number>` — `{ lg: 12, md: 8, sm: 4 }`. Column count per breakpoint.

### PANELS
`PanelDef[]` — the registry of every panel in DOM source order (which drives single-column `sm` stacking). Each `PanelDef` is `{ id: PanelId; title: string; defaultVisible: boolean; minW: number; minH: number }`. Order: canvas, signatures, sigSearch (displayed as "Signature Search"), inspector, route, intel, structure, systemNotes (displayed as "System Notes"), killStats, systemGraph, systemKillboard, tags, thera (displayed as "Eve-Scout"). `minW`/`minH` are the per-panel resize floors **in grid columns/rows** (not px) — edit them here to change how small a panel can be dragged.

### PANEL_MIN
`Record<PanelId, { minW: number; minH: number }>` — the resize floors derived from `PANELS`. Authoritative: `MapLayoutGrid` re-applies these over each stored layout item at render time, so lowering a floor takes effect for already-saved per-account layouts without disturbing their persisted positions.

### DEFAULT_MAP_LAYOUT
`MapLayoutConfig` — the fallback used when `ap_user.map_layout` is NULL. The built-in fixed layout: a tall `canvas` top-left, full-width `signatures` beneath it, and the info modules stacked in a right column. Built per breakpoint — `lg`/`md` via `wideLayout(cols)` (left canvas+signatures, right module stack), `sm` via a single-column stack in registry order. `groups` holds one singleton group per layout item (`id === its PanelId`); `hidden: []`.

### ensurePanelsPlaced(config: MapLayoutConfig): MapLayoutConfig
Forward-compat normaliser run when seeding layout state on load and when re-showing a hidden panel. Ensures every registered, **non-hidden** panel is placed in every breakpoint. "Placed" means a **member of some group in `groups[bp]`** (not merely a layout item id) — a tabbed member shares its group's cell and has no layout id of its own, so keying off layout ids would wrongly duplicate it. A panel that is a member of no group and not in `config.hidden` is appended below the existing items at `x: 0`, stacked by its `minH`, sized `Math.min(cols, max(minW, 4)) × max(minH, 4)`, and added as a matching singleton group in `groups[bp]`. Panels in `hidden` are skipped, so a hidden panel (whose layout item was removed by `removePanelFromLayout`) is not resurrected on reload, and dropping a panel from `hidden` makes it reappear here as a fresh singleton. No data migration needed for future panels.

**Parameters:**
- `config` — the layout to normalise (a migrated saved config, `DEFAULT_MAP_LAYOUT`, or a config with a panel just removed from `hidden`).

**Returns:** A config with all non-hidden panels placed. Returns the input **unchanged by reference** when nothing was missing (the common case — `DEFAULT_MAP_LAYOUT` is already complete).

### migrateLayout(config: StoredMapLayout): MapLayoutConfig
Version normaliser run before `ensurePanelsPlaced` when seeding layout state and before persisting in `setMapLayoutAction`. A pre-v2 blob has no `groups`; for each breakpoint it derives one singleton group per `layouts[bp]` item (`{ id: item.i, members: [item.i], active: item.i }`) and sets `version` to `LAYOUT_CONFIG_VERSION`, preserving the arrangement so every panel becomes its own untabbed cell.

**Parameters:**
- `config` — a layout blob as read from storage or an imported file; `groups` may be absent.

**Returns:** A complete `MapLayoutConfig`. Returns an already-grouped config's grouping intact.

### removePanelFromLayout(config: MapLayoutConfig, panel: PanelId): MapLayoutConfig
Removes `panel` from the group model in every breakpoint (the hide pathway). The panel leaves its group's `members`; if it was the group's `active` a sibling takes over, if it was the group's anchor id the group and its `layouts[bp]` item are re-keyed to a surviving member (a group id is always one of its members), and if it was the sole member the group and its grid item are dropped. Surviving groups keep their geometry. Callers then add `panel` to `hidden`.

**Parameters:**
- `config` — the current layout.
- `panel` — the panel to remove from its group.

**Returns:** The updated config. Returns the input **unchanged by reference** when `panel` is in no group.

### dedupeGroups(config: MapLayoutConfig): MapLayoutConfig
Repair normaliser run in the seed/import pipeline (after `migrateLayout`, before `ensurePanelsPlaced`). Enforces that a panel is a member of at most one group per breakpoint: the first occurrence in `groups[bp]` order wins, later duplicate memberships are stripped. A group emptied by de-duplication is dropped along with its grid item; a group whose anchor id was a stripped duplicate is re-keyed to a surviving member. Heals layouts saved while a stale `ensurePanelsPlaced` resurrected a tabbed member as a second standalone cell (the trailing duplicate loses).

**Parameters:**
- `config` — a migrated layout config.

**Returns:** The de-duplicated config. Returns the input **unchanged by reference** when every panel already appears once per breakpoint.

### PanelDef (type)
`{ id: PanelId; title: string; defaultVisible: boolean; minW: number; minH: number }`.
